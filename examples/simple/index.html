In system programming, an interrupt is a signal to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">processor</a> emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing. 
            </p>
            <p>The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">state</a>, and executing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(programming)">function</a> called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes, the processor resumes normal activities.[1] There are two types of interrupts: hardware interrupts and software interrupts.
